# Nix Helm Generator: Project Kickoff Document

## Executive Summary

This project aims to create a Nix module that generates production-ready Helm charts from Nix expressions. The module will produce static YAML manifests without Helm templating, making deployments more predictable and easier to audit. It will support all production-grade Kubernetes features while maintaining simplicity for junior DevOps engineers.

## Project Scope

### Core Objectives
- **YAML Generation**: Generate complete Helm chart YAML manifests from Nix expressions
- **Production Ready**: Support pod disruption budgets, resource limits, health checks, and other production features
- **Developer Friendly**: Simple API that junior DevOps engineers can use without deep Nix or Kubernetes expertise
- **Static Manifests**: No Helm templating - all values resolved at build time for predictability

### In Scope
- Core Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets)
- Production features (PDBs, ResourceQuotas, NetworkPolicies, Ingress)
- Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- Chart metadata and dependencies
- Validation and type checking

### Out of Scope
- Helm templating engine integration
- Dynamic value injection at runtime
- Chart repository management
- GUI/chart museum integration

### API Design

#### Basic Chart Definition
```nix
# chart.nix
{
  name = "my-app";
  version = "1.0.0";
  description = "My application";

  # Application configuration
  app = {
    image = "nginx:1.20";
    replicas = 3;
    ports = [80 443];
  };

  # Environment-specific overrides
  environments = {
    dev = { replicas = 1; };
    prod = { replicas = 5; };
  };
}
```

#### Production Features
```nix
# production.nix
{
  # Pod Disruption Budget
  pdb = {
    enabled = true;
    minAvailable = "50%";
  };

  # Resource limits and requests
  resources = {
    requests = {
      cpu = "100m";
      memory = "128Mi";
    };
    limits = {
      cpu = "500m";
      memory = "512Mi";
    };
  };

  # Health checks
  healthChecks = {
    readinessProbe = {
      httpGet = {
        path = "/health";
        port = 8080;
      };
      initialDelaySeconds = 5;
      periodSeconds = 10;
    };
  };
}
```

### Generation Pipeline

1. **Input Validation**: Validate Nix expressions against schema
2. **Resource Generation**: Create Kubernetes manifests from configuration
3. **Production Features**: Apply PDBs, limits, network policies, etc.

      image = "worker-service:v1.0";
      replicas = 3;
      env = { REDIS_URL = "redis:6379"; };
    };

    postgres = {

        size = "10Gi";
      };
    };
  };
}
```

## Conclusion

This Nix Helm Generator project will provide a powerful yet simple way to create production-ready Kubernetes deployments using Nix's declarative approach. By generating static YAML manifests, we eliminate the complexity and unpredictability of Helm templating while maintaining all the benefits of Infrastructure as Code.

The focus on junior DevOps usability ensures that the tool will be accessible to the entire team, reducing the barrier to entry for Kubernetes deployments and improving overall development velocity.
